Along with Ian Fox and Advait Maybhate, at the recent Waterloo
[Tech Retreat][techretreat], we made an app that makes finding nearby events
much easier. We're planning to continue working on this app. Right now we've
got the basic functionality set up.

You can use the latest [client demo][client] in your browser today, but be
warned that there isn't much yet. There's also an [Android app][android], but
it's already somewhat out of date and you will have to compile it yourself.
