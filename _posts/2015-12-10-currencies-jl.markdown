This is [Currencies.jl], a production-ready library that provides a easy and
consistent interface to monetary values. Check it out; the documentation should
provide a starting point.

It supports most of the features you'd want, such as custom precision, flexible
internal representation, currency conversion, and zero-cost abstraction.
