I have created an IJulia (Jupyter) notebook showcasing [automatic
differentiation] using multiple dispatch in Julia. This is a topic that I
thought was quite cool, and I think it illustrates the power of multiple
dispatch well. It's been linked on the [Teaching] page.

Some elementary understanding of calculus and linear algebra is assumed. If you
have any questions, concerns, or suggestions, I'm all ears! Please reach me on
[Twitter] or through the [GitHub] issues of this website.

The notebook itself hasn't been uploaded yet. I'll get to that as soon as
possible.
