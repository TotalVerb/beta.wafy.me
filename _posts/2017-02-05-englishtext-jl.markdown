I am pleased to announce [EnglishText.jl], a library that does all the dirty
work of handling English grammatical quirks. Presenting information to users
through prose presents many challenges that can be difficult to deal one. Not
least of those challenges is figuring out details like how to pluralize words,
when to use `a` or `an`, and how to write out a list.

What EnglishText offers is algorithms to deal with those challenges for you,
simplifying the work you have to put in to make prose read right. Many of the
features of EnglishText are currently being used in my static site generator. I
think that it is reasonably well-tested.

If you are interested in using or contributing to EnglishText, any and all
feedback and help is appreciated!
