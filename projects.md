Here are a few interesting open-source projects that Iâ€™ve worked on over the
years. I also [teach] mathematics.

## UW Student Seminars

I help run the [UW Student Seminars][student-seminars]. Several of my past
talks for the seminars are listed here.

- [Hypercomplex numbers][hypercomplex]
- [q-Analogs][q-analog]
- [Constructive Analysis][constructive]

## EnglishText.jl

Many applications display information to readers in prose format instead of
tabular format. It is often important to generate human-readable, grammatically
correct prose. However, taking care of grammatical special cases is tedious.

[EnglishText.jl](https://github.com/TotalVerb/EnglishText.jl) solves this
problem by providing a variety of convenient utility functions.

EnglishText.jl aims to

 - provide a convenient, universally useful approach to abstracting away
   grammatical special cases
 - be self-documenting where possible, but well-documented nevertheless
 - not have unnecessary performance bottlenecks

## Currencies.jl

![using Currencies; @usingcurrencies USD, CAD][currencies-img]

This is a [library][cjl] for the [Julia][julia] programming language that
supports currency arithmetic, computations, and formatting. In 2016, the
project is now under the JuliaFinance organization umbrella.

## High School Enrichment

With my friend Ian Fox, we created an [enrichment] curriculum for our high
school CS club. It covers a lot of stuff, including algorithms like
Bellman-Ford and data structures like Binary Search Trees.

## Findr

![][findr-img]

This is a [web application][findr] that allows looking for events near you.
Events can be added from the same web application. The backend is in Node.js
and PostgreSQL.

## Liquid

![a liquid game][liquid-img]

This is a [web game][liquid] in JavaScript and HTML5 canvas, using the
fabric.js library.

## Pymaze JS

![a pymaze js game][pymaze-img]

This is a [web game][pymaze] in JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. It started as a
port of my high school CS Club project, Pymaze, which was programmed in Python
and used the pygame library. After the port, some additional features were added
and the overall experience was improved.
