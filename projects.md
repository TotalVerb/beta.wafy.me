Here are a few interesting projects that Iâ€™ve worked on over the years.

## Currencies.jl

This is a [library][cjl] for the [Julia][julia] programming language that
supports currency arithmetic, computations, and formatting.

## Findr

This is a [web application][findr] that allows looking for events near you.
Events can be added from the same web application. The backend is in Node.js
and PostgreSQL.

## Liquid

This is a [web game][liquid] in JavaScript and HTML5 canvas, using the
fabric.js library.
