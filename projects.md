Here are a few interesting open-source projects that Iâ€™ve worked on over the
years. I also [teach] mathematics.

## Currencies.jl

![using Currencies; @usingcurrencies USD, CAD][currencies-img]

This is a [library][cjl] for the [Julia][julia] programming language that
supports currency arithmetic, computations, and formatting. In 2016, the
project is now under the JuliaFinance organization umbrella.

## Findr

![][findr-img]

This is a [web application][findr] that allows looking for events near you.
Events can be added from the same web application. The backend is in Node.js
and PostgreSQL.

## Liquid

![a liquid game][liquid-img]

This is a [web game][liquid] in JavaScript and HTML5 canvas, using the
fabric.js library.

## Pymaze JS

![a pymaze js game][pymaze-img]

This is a [web game][pymaze] in JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. It started as a
port of my high school CS Club project, Pymaze, which was programmed in Python
and used the pygame library. After the port, some additional features were added
and the overall experience was improved.
