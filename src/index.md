This website is a work in progress.

I’m Fengyang Wang. Sometimes I go by `@TotalVerb`. Currently, I study Mathematics at the
University of Waterloo.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/TotalVerb). Here are some other places you
might find me:

 - [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3575047/fengyang-wang)
 - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fengyang97)

I used to maintain a blog, [Kaninchensicher](https://kaninchensicher.wordpress.com/), but I
am going to try to migrate it to my website. In recent years, I generally prefer to
microblog.

You can also read my [résumé](/résumé/), if you like. Thanks for visiting!
