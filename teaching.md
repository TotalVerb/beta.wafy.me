I teach Olympic Math for Grade 4 students at the [Grand River Chinese
School][grcs]. This page contains samples of some of the material taught.

## Number Theory

Here is the [lesson plan][ntlp] for the Number Theory unit, which covers (at a
basic level) parity, divisibility, primes, the fundamental theorem of
arithmetic, GCDs and LCMs, the Euclidean algorithm, and an introduction to
modular arithmetic.
